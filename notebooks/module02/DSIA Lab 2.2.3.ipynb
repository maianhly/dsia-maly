As a programmer, you could determine everything about that object just by looking at the string its `__repr__` returns. This brings me to my next point: there is a *de facto* standard that using `eval(repr(obj)) == obj `, meaning you can take any object's `__repr__` string, evaluate it as python code, and get an equivalent object back out. This isn't always possible, but generally you want your `__repr__` string to be similar to how you would create an object.\n",
